/*
        biggest substring of matching characters
            given a String find the biggest substring of chars that match and print it.

            ex: aaabbbcccccddddee output: ccccc


FLOW:
    go through each char in a loop
    look for each substring, which is repeating chars
        ex: aaa

        check next character to see if it is a different one

        check if it's the biggest substring
